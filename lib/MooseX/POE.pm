=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::POE is a L<Moose> wrapper around a L<POE::Session>.

=head1 KEYWORDS

=method event $name $subref

Create an event handler named $name.

=head1 METHODS

Default POE-related methods are provided by L<MooseX::POE::Meta::Trait::Object|MooseX::POE::Meta::Trait::Object>
which is applied to your base class (which is usually L<Moose::Object|Moose::Object>) when
you use this module. See that module for the documentation for. Below is a list
of methods on that class so you know what to look for:

=method get_session_id

Get the internal POE Session ID, this is useful to hand to other POE aware
functions.

=method yield

=method call

=method delay

=method alarm

=method alarm_add

=method delay_add

=method alarm_set

=method alarm_adjust

=method alarm_remove

=method alarm_remove_all

=method delay_set

=method delay_adjust

A cheap alias for the same POE::Kernel function which will gurantee posting to the object's session.

=method STARTALL

=method STOPALL

=head1 NOTES ON USAGE WITH L<MooseX::Declare>

L<MooseX::Declare|MooseX::Declare> support is still "experimental". Meaning that I don't use it,
I don't have any code that uses it, and thus I can't adequately say that it
won't cause monkeys to fly out of any orifices on your body beyond what the
tests and the SYNOPSIS cover.

That said there are a few caveats that have turned up during testing.

1. The C<method> keyword doesn't seem to work as expected. This is an
integration issue that is being resolved but I want to wait for
L<MooseX::Declare|MooseX::Declare> to gain some more polish on their slurpy
arguments.

2. MooseX::POE attempts to re-export L<Moose>, which
L<MooseX::Declare> has already exported in a custom fashion.
This means that you'll get a keyword clash between the features that
L<MooseX::Declare|MooseX::Declare> handles for you and the features that Moose
handles. To work around this you'll need to write:

    use MooseX::POE qw(event);
    # or
    use MooseX::POE::SweetArgs qw(event);
    # or
    use MooseX::POE::Role qw(event);

to keep MooseX::POE from exporting the sugar that
L<MooseX::Declare|MooseX::Declare> doesn't like. This is fixed in the Git
version of L<MooseX::Declare|MooseX::Declare> but that version (as of this
writing) is not on the CPAN.
